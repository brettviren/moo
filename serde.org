* Overview

Serialization the process by which structured data is converted to a
linear array of bytes and deserialization is the inverse.  As they
must work together the pair is sometimes called a serde.  A serde
typically refers to higher level formatting of the bytes while lower
level formatting is sometimes called encode/decode or codec.  Whatever
the name, *moo* provides support for generating serde methods to use
with *moo* generated types.

This example will walk through how to use *moo* to provide a serde
through JSON or MessagePack serialization using ~nlohmann::json~ (using
labels "NLJS" and "NLMP" respectively) and a higher performance
MessagePack using the library from https://msgpack.org (using label
"MSGP").

* Schema

The example will use the schema from the [[file:oschema.org][oschema]] example.
