This repository is a playground of ideas on leveraging the power of
modeling software as data and generated code from those models.  Some
of it is actually useful but in general it is meant to explore and
demonstrate ideas and not intended for production (as-is).

For some entries into what is here see:

- [[file:moc.org][moc]] :: model oriented configuration, for a design and demo how to apply moo ideas to complex application configuration problems.

- [[file:moo.org][moo]] :: model oriented objects, for a more broad consideration.

- [[file:README.org][README]] :: the source readme file
