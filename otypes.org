#+title: ~moo~ ç„¡ /otypes/
#+subtitle: Defining objects with ~moo~ /oschema/ types
#+setupfile: other/setup-topic.org

* Overview

*moo* /otypes/ is way to produce instances of /oschema/ types that tries to
follow a /valid-by-construction/ pattern.  In general, /otypes/ are native
language types (eg those of Python) which derive from /oschema/ schema
data structures.  

For example, in the [[file:oschema.org][oschema]] document we saw some basic use of the
general /otypes/ pattern applied as C++ codegen in the ~structs.hpp.j2~
and ~nljs.hpp.j2~ templates.  When instantiating a codegen'ed C++ ~struct~
we have some immediate validity guarantees.  They may then
automatically transfer to a JSON object that may be derived from the
C++ ~struct~.

The rest of this document describes how *moo* applies the /otypes/ pattern
in Python.  With the use of the ~moo.otypes~ Python module, user code
may access Python classes corresponding to /oschema/ types and in
instantiating them as Python objects gain some /valid-by-construction/
guarantees.

in the context of one particular application.

* Usage

The ~moo.otypes~ module provides high level functions to construct types
from /oschema/.  They make use of lower-level Python metaprogramming for
the actual type construction which is also in this module.

** Individual type construction

We may make an individual type from /oschema/ data structure which is
expressed as keyword arguments to the ~moo.otypes.make_type()~ function.
For example:

#+begin_src python :exports both :results output
  import moo.otypes
  Age = moo.otypes.make_type(
      name="Age", doc="An age in years",
      schema="number", dtype='i4', path='a.b')
  myage = Age(42)  # my forever age
  print(f'{Age}, {myage}, {myage.pod()}')
  import a.b
  myage2 = Age(18)
  print(f'{a.b.Age}, {myage2}, {myage2.pod()}')

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: <class 'a.b.Age'>, <number Age: 42>, 42
: <class 'a.b.Age'>, <number Age: 18>, 18

#+begin_note
The ~moo.otypes.make_type()~ directly returns a Python type object (aka
Python class) and it "places" the type object into the module tree
given the schema structure's ~.path~ attribute.  
#+end_note

We may try to use our otype with invalid data:

#+begin_example
  myage = Age("older than the hills")
#+end_example

Which will return an error like:

#+begin_example
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 8, in <module>
  File "<number Age>", line 13, in __init__
  File "/home/bv/dev/moo/moo/otypes.py", line 485, in update
    self._value = numpy.array(val, dtype)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'older than the hills'
#+end_example

This error illustrates how the /valid-by-construction/ pattern works.
It's not that magic is performed and the data is miraculously valid.
Rather, we the developer are immediately punished if we attempt to
violate the schema.  

#+begin_note
We may also produce an object from these (or more generic) types and
validate that object against schema.  It is important to know that the
constraints asserted by these two validation procedures are somewhat
disjoint.  As ~moo.otypes~ matures it may gain more rigor, but for now
the JSON Schema based validation on a final object will catch mistakes
that ~moo.otypes~ will miss during object construction.
#+end_note


** Schema structure array 

Creation of a /system of related types/ is done with an array of data
structures describing its schema and the Python types are constructed
with the plural function ~moo.otypes.make_types()~.  For example:

#+begin_src python :exports both :results output
  import moo.otypes
  schema = [dict(name="Pet", schema="enum",
                 symbols=["cat", "dog", "early personal computer"],
                 default="cat",
                 path="my.home.office",
                 doc="A kind of pet"),
            dict(name="Desk", schema="record",
                 fields=[
                     dict(name="ontop", item="my.home.office.Pet"),
                 ],
                 path="my.home.office",
                 doc="Model my desk")]
  moo.otypes.make_types(schema)

  from my.home.office import Desk, Pet
  desk = Desk(ontop="cat")
  print(f'{Desk}, {desk}, {desk.pod()}, {desk.ontop}')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: <class 'my.home.office.Desk'>, <record Desk, fields: {ontop}>, {'ontop': 'cat'}, cat

#+begin_note
The schema structure array is assumed to be sorted in topological
order of type dependencies.  Here, this is implicitly assured by how
the ~schema~ array is formed.  In more complex code one may rely on
~moo.oschema.toposort()~ to produce a sorted schema array.
#+end_note

** Load types from file

The highest layer function is ~moo.otypes.load_types()~.  It is a mere
convenience function that combines the *moo* method to load a schema
file and a call to ~make_types()~ on the result.  

#+begin_note
Any file format that *moo* supports may be used to provide schema, while
Jsonnet is recommended.  See the [[file:oschema.org][oschema]] document for more details on
how to construct schema files.
#+end_note

We can see ~load_types()~ in action using a schema that is part of the
*moo* test suite:

#+begin_src python :exports both :results output
  import os
  import moo.otypes

  # Directly make a type in Python to use for an "any" below
  moo.otypes.make_type(schema="string", name="Uni", path="test.basetypes")
  from test.basetypes import Uni

  # We locate and load a test schema file
  here = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "test")
  types = moo.otypes.load_types("test-ogen-oschema.jsonnet", [here])

  from app import Person
  per = Person(email="foo@example.com", counts=[42],
               affil=Uni("Snooty U"), mbti="judging")
  print(f'{Person}, {per}, {per.affil}')
  print(per.pod())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: <class 'app.Person'>, <record Person, fields: {email, email2, counts, affil, mbti}>, Snooty U
: {'email': 'foo@example.com', 'email2': 'me@example.com', 'counts': [42], 'affil': 'Snooty U', 'mbti': 'judging'}


#+begin_note
In the above we give ~load_types()~ a file system path (ie, ~[here]~) so
that files in the *moo* test directory will be located.  *moo* will search
this path when a file is given as a relative path.

When using the ~moo~ Python module the application may set a default
path instead of providing one to every ~moo.io.load()~ call (which
~load_types()~ forwards to).  An example of this usage is given below.

When using the ~moo~ CLI one may set the environment variable
~MOO_LOAD_PATH~ to equivalently provide this default load path.
#+end_note


* Help

Type information and any ~doc~ strings given in the schema are reflected
into the constructed Python types.  This information can be displayed
using usual Python meta interrogation methods.  For example:

#+begin_src python :exports both :results output
  import os
  import moo.otypes
  import moo.io

  here = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "test")
  moo.io.default_load_path = [here]
  types = moo.otypes.load_types("test-ogen-oschema.jsonnet")

  from app import Person

  help(Person)
