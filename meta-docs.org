* Layout

The moo documentation source tends to reference moo code source via
relative paths and thus it is location sensitive.  Currently, GH Pages
point to the root of the repo and thus it is heavily populated.  

** TODO move moo documentation into ~docs/~

This will require correcting a lot of paths in the ~.org~ source.  This
future reorg does *not* include making ~docs/~ the root of the GH Pages.

* Export

HTML is produced by running a manual export (~C-c C-e h h~) in a ~.org~
source.  This produces an HTML file of the same basename except
~README.org~ files have directives to export to ~index.html~.  

** TODO automate moo documentation export

* Themes

HTML themes are provided by the fantastic work of ~fniessen~ (readtheorg) and ~alphapapa~ (darksun).  To allow the moo GH pages to be self contained, copies of their files are interned.

#+begin_example
  $ git-subrepo clone https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes docs/static/org-html-themes
  $ git-subrepo clone https://github.com/alphapapa/org-html-theme-darksun docs/static/org-html-theme-darksun
  $ cd docs/
  $ cp static/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg-local.setup setup-topic.org
  $ cp static/org-html-theme-darksun/export/setup/theme-darksun-local.setup setup-index.org  
  $ emacs setup-*.org  # fix paths
  $ cd static/
  $ ln -s org-html-themes/src/* .
  $ ln -s org-html-theme-darksun/export/styles/darksun .
#+end_example

The symlinks are made to compress the URLs and defend somewhat against
upstream repo reorg.  The ~setup-*.org~ files need various paths fixed
to match expectations set by GH Pages settings.  As their name
implies, the two themes are meant for two different types of pages.

- ~setup-index.org~ :: used for ~README.org/index.html~ 
- ~setup-topic.org~ :: and for any "topic" documents
