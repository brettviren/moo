'''SSOT for moo version.  

The version string is manually updated so expect to find some commits
where convention is broken.

The convention followed is that development after minor versions are
named A.B.x-dev ("x" is literal) or if work is intentionally leading
up to a release then A.B.CrcY ("Y" is literal) is used.

This value is used in setup.py and available as moo.__version__ which
is exported to the CLI via "moo version".
