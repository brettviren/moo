* Overview

In *moo*, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is to *behavior* what schema is to
data structure.  That is, we model some desired behavior in the usual
terms of FSM and from that model we generate code that enacts the
behavior.  

We will first describe how to model an FSM in moo /oschema/ and then
from such models how to use a *moo* template to generate an FSM based on
[[https://github.com/boost-ext/sml][boost-ext/sml]] for C++ projects and how for Python projects how to use
the model to construct an FSM based on the [[https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions][transitions]] package.

* Schema

As with any model in *moo* we describe an FSM with a data structure and
that data structure adheres to a schema.  This schema is relatively
simple and is described in *moo* [[file:oschema.org][/oschema/]] form in [[file:examples/fsm/fsm-schema.jsonnet]].
